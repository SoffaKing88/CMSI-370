Imgur API Project

I consider my 5 non-trivial web service functions to be

1. Generating the top 10 "Viral" images from Imgur.com
2. Generating the top 10 "Meme" images from Imgur.com
3. Searching for a subreddit and producing the top 10 
    images from that subreddit
4. Searching for anything and producing the top 10 images
    related to your search query
5. Producing 10 random images from Imgur.com
